# Ball in double hoop system
This repository contains codes and drawings for the ball in a double system. A draft of a video presenting this system is to be found under [this link](https://youtu.be/GBKhRHtjpvQ).

As the codes still undergo rapid changes, they are not well documented. The documentation should get better as the project will progress and things settle down.
